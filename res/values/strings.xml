        Welcome to the Enhanced Drake Equation Calculator!
        Enter your values for each of the steps of the enhanced Drake Equation and 
        then click on the Submit button at the bottom of the screen.  The results
        consist of the estimated number of civilizations in the galaxy AND the
        expected average distance between civilizations.

    <string name="numstars_question">
        How many stars are there in the Milky Way galaxy?
    </string>
    <string name="numstars_text">
        The estimates of the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy range from around 
        100 billion to over 1 trillion.  A middle-of-the-road consensus estimate is 
        400 billion.
        \n\nOne version of the Drake Equation starts with the formation rate of stars.
        I prefer the version that starts with the total number of existing stars,
        because the purpose of the Drake Equation is to guess how many civilizations
        exist right now, not how many will exist 4 billion years from now. 
    </string>
    <string name="spectral_question">
        What fraction of stars are of the appropriate spectral type?
    </string>
    <string name="spectral_text">
        For some reason, most examples of Drake Equation in action do not include this
        factor in any step of the process.  While you could incorporate this factor into 
        the average number of habitable planets per star, the fact remains that we know 
        far more about other stars than we do about exoplanets.
        \n\nThe sun is a main sequence G2 star.  Lower F-type, all G-type, and upper 
        K-type main sequence stars can support a civilization.  Only these stars have sufficiently
        long lifetimes AND a habitable zone.  Such stars are roughly 10% of all stars in the galaxy.

    <string name="ghz_question">
        What fraction of the above stars are in the Galactic Habitable Zone?
    </string>
    <string name="ghz_text">
        For some reason, most examples of the Drake Equation in action also ignore this factor.
        
        \n\nThe inner region of our galaxy is too dangerous,
        and its outer region is short on metals.  The metal content is increasing over time, which means
        that the Galactic Habitable Zone was smaller in the past and will be larger in the future.

		\n\nIt is generally believed that only 5%-10% of the stars in our galaxy are in the Galactic Habitable Zone.

    <string name="age_question">
        What fraction of the above stars are old enough to have allowed a
        civilization to form?
    </string>
    <string name="age_text">
        For some reason, most examples of the Drake Equation in action do not take into account the ages
        of the stars.  It takes several billion years for a new star to spawn a civilization.  Thus, it is 
        unlikely that stars significantly younger than our sun have had enough time to give rise to another 
        civilization.  This criterion eliminates many metal-rich stars, as metallicity
        in the galaxy was lower billions of years ago.  It is possible that we are part of the first group of 
        civilizations to form.

    <string name="planets_question">
        What fraction of suitable stars are orbited by planets?
    </string>
    
    <string name="planets_text">
		This factor in the Drake Equation is likely to be quite high (near 1).  Astronomers have found
		numerous exoplanets, and there are likely numerous additional exoplanets that we
		cannot detect with our current methods.  Remember that the current inventory of known 
		exoplanets is skewed towards the hot Jupiters simply because they are the most detectable.
    </string>
    
    <string name="habitable_question">
        What is the average number of habitable planets per star in the above planetary systems?
    </string>
    
    <string name="habitable_text">
        Most discussions of the Drake Equation are much too optimistic at guessing the number of
        habitable worlds.
		\n\n
        Even given an ideal star, there are still potential flies in the ointment.  For every Earth that
        exists, there may be several other worlds more like Venus, Mars, or the moon.  We know very little 
        about what aspects of our solar system are typical and what aspects are anomalous.
    </string>
    
    
    <string name="life_question">
        What fraction of habitable planets are inhabited by lifeforms?
    </string>
    
    <string name="life_text">
        In the 4.6-billion-year history of the Earth, life has been present in all but the first few
        hundred million years of it .  This suggests using an optimistic number (near 1).  On the other 
        hand, our sample size is only 1.  Since we exist but have not explored even one other planetary system
        (much less many of them), we have not seen the failures.  That said, even if you assume that
        life is inevitable, your figure for this factor of the Drake Equation should be at
        least slightly lower than 1, as it does take time for life to evolve.
    </string>
    
    <string name="complex_question">
        Of the planets that have life, what fraction have complex life?
    </string>
    
    <string name="complex_text">
    	This factor is specific to the Enhanced Drake Equation and is an intermediate step in
    	the path from simple life to intelligent life.  Complex life is much more fragile than simple life.
    	An optimist would say that the evolution from simple life to complex life is inevitable given a few 
    	billion years.  A pessimist would say that this is a low-probability
    	event even given several billion years.  We cannot draw any firm conclusions with a sample size of 1.
    	That said, I think that there are numerous worlds with only simple life, which is much hardier than
    	than complex life.
    </string>
    
    
    <string name="intelligent_question">
        Of the planets that have complex life, what fraction 
        have intelligent life?
    </string>
    
    <string name="intelligent_text">
        An optimist would point out the trend towards increasingly complex life and the relatively modest time 
        (1 billion years out of the 4.6-billion-year history of the Earth) that it took for complex life to evolve 
        into intelligent life.  A pessimist would point out that very few species (humans, dolphins, and whales)
        are highly intelligent, and only one has managed to implement advanced technology.  A sample size of just
        one planet makes it impossible to generalize with confidence.
    </string>
    
    <string name="communication_question">
        Of the planets with intelligent life, on what fraction has this intelligent
        life developed interstellar communications?
    </string>
    
    <string name="communication_text">
        An optimist would point out the relatively short time (a few million years out
        of the 4.6-billion-year history of the Earth) that it took for our species to develop advanced technology
        for interstellar communication.  A pessimist would suggest possible scenarios in which an intelligent
        species does not develop this technology, such as beings that live underwater or that lack opposable thumbs
        (or the equivalent).  Again, a sample size of just one planet makes it impossible to generalize with confidence.
    </string>
    
    <string name="survive_question">
        What fraction of the above civilizations are still alive and still capable
        of interstellar communications?
    </string>
    
    <string name="survive_text" formatted="false">
        I side with the optimists.  Once a civilization has self-sufficient space colonies, it becomes effectively
        immortal.  Those who assign tiny numbers for this term in the Drake Equation assume that self-destruction 
        is certain. 
        \n\nI think that alien sociology could be substantially different from ours, and it is even possible that 
        most civilizations do survive and thrive, even if ours does not.  Even if the worst case scenarios of global 
        warming are not averted, a lucky few people could survive, and their descendants could create another advanced 
        but more sustainable civilization.
